# ME381: Introduction to Elasticity

### Key Features of the Implementation

- Uses DH transformation matrices from Question 3
- Implements both forward and inverse kinematics algorithms
- Provides 3D visualization of robot configurations
- Finds multiple inverse kinematics solutions (elbow-up/elbow-down)
- Verifies inverse kinematics solutions using forward kinematics
- Handles workspace limitations and unreachable targets
- Operates in the xy-plane as per the robot design
